COMP 2402 - Abstract Data Structures
========

All assignments with solutions from Dr. Pat Morin's Winter 2013 run of COMP 2402 at Carleton University.

All assignments were marked on an automated testing server created by the teaching assistants and Pat. 

Pat is an excellent teacher to have. He made a dry and boring class enjoyable. Pat teaches this class with his very good textbook [Open Data Structures](https://github.com/patmorin/ods).
